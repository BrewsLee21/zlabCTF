    <h1>Linux Terminal Basics</h1>
    <p>In Linux, you can run multiple commands in a single line by separating them with a semicolon. For example:</p>
    <pre>$ ls; pwd; echo "Hello, World!"</pre>
    <p>This can be useful when you want to chain commands together or automate tasks. Be aware that this functionality can be exploited in code injection attacks, where an attacker injects commands into an input field that get executed in the terminal.</p>
