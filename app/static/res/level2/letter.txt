Hey friend,

I hope you're doing well! I recently learned a cool trick on the Linux terminal that I wanted to share with you. You can actually run multiple commands in one line by separating them with a semicolon. For example:

$ ls; pwd; echo "Hello, World!"

It can be super useful for automating tasks or chaining commands together. Let me know if you try it out!

Take care,
Your Friend
